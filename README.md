# SeewoManual
The repository is for usage of a complete and profound manual for the Seewo Whiteboard device, which devotes itself into making the use more specified and simple.

We welcome any alumnis or students in JZZX with Seewo-operating experience to join us in this humble but genuine career.

For more information, contact us via GitHub or QQ chat groups (which will be available soon).
